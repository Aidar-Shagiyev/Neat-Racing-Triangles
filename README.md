# Neat-Racing-Triangles
Use reinforcement learning (specifically [NEAT](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) to teach little triangles how to race. During development I focused more on building fun stuff myself and being pythonic rather than optimizing for execution time (hence the silly Vector class and no numpy whatsoever).
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
  * Python 3.4+
  * neat-python 0.92+
### Running the race
To run the simulation just execute run.py:
```
python run.py
```
This will result in something like this:
